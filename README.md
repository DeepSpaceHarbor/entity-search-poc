# TL;DR?

There are many data providers offering people and company databases, and each database comes with it's own set of properties. The goal of this project was to explore whether an LLM can take a description from a user and transform it into several quesries (JSON files), where each query matches the filters from a given database.

The answer is that, yes, it can be done, with a little bit of prompting and user review in the end. 
You can find out for yourself by plaing with the [demo on this link](https://deepspaceharbor.github.io/entity-search-poc/).

⚠️ This is Proof Of Concept project, if you get stuck, reload the page.

⚠️ All of the work is done in the browser with the help of web based LLM. It may not work on every device.
